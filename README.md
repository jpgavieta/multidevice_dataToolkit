# MultiDevice DataToolkit

A python-based portable and customizable data processing pipeline for variable standardization and validation of multiple devices.
Includes a notebook to demonstrate how to use and apply the data for statistical analysis. 

The **etl (extract transform load) data pipeline** standardizes data variables, validates data types, and categorizes variables into usable dataframes (e.g. builds a GIS dataframe for mapping) — ready for data anlaysis and visualization between devices. 

The etl logic based on `device_types` as separate streams of data, not based on participants. 

It is expandable for more device types, which each require its own custom  parser. 

## Data Flow from Multiple Devices

The data pipeline starts from whereever the data is kept (either shared folder per device type, the cloud API of each device, or a database table of the device type). It is triggered upon command via `load.py` that tells `extract.py` to pull data from wherever, `transform.py` applies the parser logic specific to device, and returns an organized and subdivided dataframe per device.
