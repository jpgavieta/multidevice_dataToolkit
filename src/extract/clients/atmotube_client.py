"""
Atmotube Cloud API client 
    -   Per-device, per-date-range raw data pulls
    -   Fetches historical data sequentially
    -   Bounded thread concurrency ACROSS chunks (not within one — see note below)

HANDLES: 
    -   date-range chunking (conservative safety window)
    -   cursor-based pagination within each chunk (API returns next_cursor until exhausted)

Chunks are fetched sequentially — with typical backfill ranges (a few dozen chunks at most) 

KNOWN UNKNOWN:
- The real rate limit for this API hasn't been confirmed yet.
