# src/extract/config/tokens.py
"""
Central credential resolver for all device APIs.

Each service (Fitbit, Atmotube, ...) has its own auth module with its own logic, since auth mechanisms differ (OAuth vs. static API key).
This file is just the single import surface clients use, so fitbit_client.py and atmotube_client.py don't need to know which specific module their credentials come from.

TO ADD A NEW DEVICE API:
    1. Create a new module in extract/config/ for that device's auth logic.
    2. Add a new function here that calls the new module's credential getter.
    3. Update the device config (devices.yml) to include any new secrets needed.
