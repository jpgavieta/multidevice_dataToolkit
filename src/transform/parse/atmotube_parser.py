# transform/parsers/atmotube_parser.py
"""
Parses raw Atmotube API responses (from extract/clients/atmotube_client.py,
live or replayed via backfill_atmotube.py) into row-dicts matching
atmotube.readings — ready for execute_values(), same shape fitbit_parser.py emits.

date is already true UTC ISO 8601 — no explicit parsing happens here or in
load.py; the raw string is passed straight through to psycopg2, and Postgres
does the text -> TIMESTAMPTZ cast implicitly on insert into recorded_at.

latitude/longitude are kept as plain float fields on each row-dict (NOT built
into a geometry object here) — load.py's _build_location() turns them into an
EWKT point string at insert time (wrapped in ST_GeomFromEWKT(...) via the
WKT_COLUMNS mapping in _upsert_rows()), so both keys survive this parser only
to be popped by load.py's _prepare_atmotube_rows() once the geometry's built.

    atmotube.readings' columns exactly (minus id/ingestion_id/location, which
    load.py fills in: ingest_id once the raw row is inserted, location from
    latitude/longitude via _build_location()).

    timezone is accepted but unused — Atmotube's 'date' field is already true UTC,
    no localization needed. It's here only so transform.py can call every parser
